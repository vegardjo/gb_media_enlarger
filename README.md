# Gutenberg media enlarger

Drupal module that expands on the drupalmedia/drupal-media-entity Gutenberg block, to make it expandable in a modal. 

It includes a template file you might need to copy to your theme. 

By default it will open the expanded image in the image style "wide". You will need to add this as an image style, or change to a different one by editing the .module file.
